<h3 align="center">Hello!! And welcome to Pete's Incredible Football Project!<h3>

##### What is this project and why did I make it?
  Pete's Incredible Football Project is an incredible Spring Boot API. It was made as a test of what I've learned over the last few weeks on topics such as Git, Jira, MySQL, Java, Spring, Maven etc. 
  
##### How did I expect the project to go? And how did it go?
  At the start of the week I expected the project to be wider in scope than it has ended up being. Using Jira and Git was straightforward, as was writing most of the Java for the final API. However, I found trying to incorporate additional tables and DTOs into the project to be a bit more difficult than I was hoping. To make sure that I finished the project in time I therefore limited it to a single table of footballers in a MySQL database. Despite the reduced scope, the finished project is incredible.
  
##### How could the project be improved in the future?
  Even projects as incredible as this one can be improved. An obvious improvement would be to add a second table of teams, and each team would have multiple players from the "player" table associated with it. This is what I wanted the project to be originally.
  
##### Please behold how incredible this project is. With this project, using Postman, one can:
  
Add players to a "player" table within a MySQL database

View players currently held in the database

![Get all players](https://github.com/PeteH1/PIFP/blob/feature4-README/screenshots/Get%20all%20players.PNG)
  
(I also added a custom exception for when you try and retrieve a player that isn't there)

Update the details of existing players

Delete players

But the fun doesn't end there!
  Look how the data persists to the database:

And admire the incredible test coverage:

To have created such an incredible project required incredible project management, which was all done using [this incredible Jira board](https://team-1629815281094.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PIFP/boards/3)
  
I hope you have enjoyed learning about Pete's Incredible Football Project. Thank you for visiting, and farewell <3.
